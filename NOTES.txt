1. Simplify authentication scheme and get rid of options if possible
   Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling
   Support unsecured paths?

2. Compare framework classes with other samples including Serverless and consolidate all
   LoggerFactory / LogEntry to improve first
   ExceptionMiddleware has also been improved
   Also a default ApplicationExceptionHandler and CustomClaimsProvider
   Also the use of JToken to allow strings or objects
   Check file by file
