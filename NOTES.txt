  Non standard Okta introspect error response:
  {
    "errorCode":"invalid_client",
    "errorSummary":"Invalid value for 'client_id' parameter.",
    "errorLink":"invalid_client",
    "errorId":"oaeiwRKEkpxRtefQlw8elwKZA",
    "errorCauses":[]
  }

----
1. Add perf instrumentation and test
   Then process performance thresholds from config and test with zero configured

2. Child authorizer
   Logging during auth failures and check Okta messages further

3. Inject claims into controllers only and change service / repository as for other samples
   Do application error translation

4. Error abstractions improvements and ErrorCodes source files
   Logic with zero API dependencies

5. ErrorUtils as a handler feels a little wrong
   No exception details for long press
   Make details a JObject or a string, and also for performance threshold

6. Internal and sealed framework classes

7. Compare framework classes with other samples and consolidate
   Include serverless and deploy it
   Consolidate Okta errors for all samples
   Support unsecured paths?

8. Run load test and Elastic Search
   Log entry consolidation across Node and Java

9. Simplify authentication scheme and get rid of options if possible
   Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling
