FIRST STEPS
-----------
1. First test fully stubbed out and failing using an APIClient and stubbed out Wiremock class

2. Fix it by completing Wiremock, so that first test passes

3. Complete other tests

ALSO
----
1. Get stylecop working for test code

2. Get publishing working without tests

3. Look at jose v4 latest invalid token errors and compare to previous
   Also is there support for downloading JWKS or validating issuer + audience + expiry?

4. Separate load test to get running in the most basic way

5. README update + code merge

6. Blog overview update

NOTES
-----
1. Created with 'dotnet new nunit'

2. Use TestContext.Progress.WriteLine for debug output

GENERAL TODO
------------
1. Other samples - comments in test setup about test configuration are wrong
