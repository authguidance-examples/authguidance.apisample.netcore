NOTES
-----
1. Created with 'dotnet new nunit'

2. Use TestContext.Progress.WriteLine for debug output

3. Look at jose v4 latest invalid token errors and compare to previous
   Also is there support for downloading JWKS or validating issuer + audience + expiry?

4. Get publishing working without tests
