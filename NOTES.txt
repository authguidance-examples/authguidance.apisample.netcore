1. Avoid recreating the logger factory and get from the container
   Create proper log entry classes starting with logging the API name
   Fill in fields to a fairly good level
     
2. Performance thresholds from configuration
   Complete logging including child authorizer, Elastic Search flow and load test

3. Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling
     
4. Coding improvements around error abstractions and ErrorCodes source file

5. Inject claims into controllers only and change service / repository as for other samples
   Create base framework classes to support application error translation

6. No exception details for long press
   Make details a JObject
   Fix Okta response above

7. Support unsecured paths
