  Non standard Okta introspect error response:
  {
    "errorCode":"invalid_client",
    "errorSummary":"Invalid value for 'client_id' parameter.",
    "errorLink":"invalid_client",
    "errorId":"oaeiwRKEkpxRtefQlw8elwKZA",
    "errorCauses":[]
  }

----
1. Compare startup errors to other samples
   Read and apply performance thresholds from configuration, to complete code
   Test both forms of startup error reporting

2. Simplify authentication scheme and get rid of options if possible

3. Fill in all fields and implement a child authorizer to complete the logging implementation
   Test logging during auth failures
     
4. Coding improvements around error abstractions and ErrorCodes source file
   Use internal sealed classes

5. Run load test and Elastic Search
   Log entry consolidation across Node and Java

6. Merge to master
   Make calls to logEntry consistent across all API stacks including serverless

5. Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling

6. Inject claims into controllers only and change service / repository as for other samples
   Create base framework classes to support application error translation

7. No exception details for long press
   Make details a JObject or a string, and also for performance threshold

7. Fix Okta response above
   Support unsecured paths
