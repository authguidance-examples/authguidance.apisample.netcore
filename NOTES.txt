  Non standard Okta introspect error response:
  {
    "errorCode":"invalid_client",
    "errorSummary":"Invalid value for 'client_id' parameter.",
    "errorLink":"invalid_client",
    "errorId":"oaeiwRKEkpxRtefQlw8elwKZA",
    "errorCauses":[]
  }

----
1. Error abstractions improvements

2. ErrorCodes source files

3. ErrorUtils as a handler feels a little wrong
   Compare with other tech

4. Application error translation
   Logic with zero API dependencies
   ExtendedException to test via ErrorFactory

5. No exception details for long press
   Make details a JObject or a string, and also for performance threshold

6. Fix up authorizer logging - too many entries and wrong data?
   Logging during auth failures and check Okta messages further

7. Internal and sealed framework classes

8. Compare framework classes with other samples and consolidate
   Include serverless and deploy it
   Consolidate Okta errors for all samples
   Support unsecured paths?

9. Run load test and Elastic Search
   Log entry consolidation across Node and Java

10. Simplify authentication scheme and get rid of options if possible
    Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
    Review and aim to improve principal handling
