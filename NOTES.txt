1. Read performance thresholds from configuration
   Get startup error reporting
   Get the sample working again

2. Logger factory usage to improve in line with other samples
   Fill in all fields
     
3. Run load test and Elastic Search
   Log entry consolidation across Node and Java

4. Coding improvements around error abstractions and ErrorCodes source file
   Use internal sealed classes

5. Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling

6. Inject claims into controllers only and change service / repository as for other samples
   Create base framework classes to support application error translation

7. No exception details for long press
   Make details a JObject or a string, and also for performance threshold

7. Fix Okta response above
   Support unsecured paths
