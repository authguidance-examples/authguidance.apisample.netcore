1. ERROR STRUCTURE
   OAuthErrorUtils to improve
   BusinessError
   ExtendedException for file read errors and throw via factory
   Application error translation
   Logic with zero API dependencies

2. Internal and sealed framework classes

3. ERROR CONTENT
   No exception details for long press
   Make details and log context a JObject or a string, and also for performance threshold

4. AUTHORIZER LOGGING
   Fix up authorizer logging - too many entries and wrong data?
   Logging during auth failures and check Okta messages further

5. Compare framework classes with other samples and consolidate all
   Include serverless and deploy it
   Consolidate Okta errors for all samples
   Support unsecured paths?

6. Run load test and Elastic Search
   Log entry consolidation across Node and Java

7. Simplify authentication scheme and get rid of options if possible
   Can I get rid of data contracts for claims serialization?
   Review and aim to improve principal handling
