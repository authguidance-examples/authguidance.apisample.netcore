STEP 1
------
1. Complete other integration tests and update README
   Node and Java APIs: comments in test setup about test configuration are wrong

2. Look at jose v4 latest invalid token errors and compare to previous
   Also is there support for downloading JWKS or validating issuer + audience + expiry?
   Aim to use jose-jwt types as much as possible

3. Test against SPA
   Ensure that publishing still works, including cloud native deployment
   
4. README update + code merge

STEP 2
------
1. Use Wiremock as a standalone process if possible, so that it can be deployed easier?

2. Load test basics and ability to run an extra task

3. Load test completion

4. Blog overview update
   Created with 'dotnet new nunit'
   Use TestContext.Progress.WriteLine for debug output
